These external components are mostly linked to and powered by the Arduino, with the exception of the LiDAR that is directly connected to and run by the Pi. 
-	Motors - Enable Alex to move in any direction
-	LiDAR - Serves as the ‘eyes’ of Alex as it maps out the surrounding environment
-	Infrared Sensors - Allow detection of nearby obstacles to prevent collision
-	Colour Sensors - Allow detection of colour to identify objects
